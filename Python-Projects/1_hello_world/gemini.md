# Project 1: Hello, World! & Basic I/O

This project is your first step into Python programming. We'll learn how to:

1.  **Get input from the user:** We'll use the `input()` function to ask the user for their name.
2.  **Store that input in a variable:** We'll save the user's name in a variable called `name`.
3.  **Print a message to the screen:** We'll use the `print()` function to display a personalized greeting.

## Code

```python
# 1. Get the user's name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# 2. Greet the user
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the world of Python.")
```

## How to Run the Code

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the `1_hello_world` directory.
3.  Run the script using the command: `python3 main.py`
