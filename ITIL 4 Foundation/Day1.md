## 1. Key concepts of service management
### 1.1 Key concepts of services and service management
- **Service**: a means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to 
                achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
- **Service management**: a set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for
customers in the form of services.
- **Customer**: the role that defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the
outcomes of service consumption.
- **User**: the role that uses services.
- **Sponsor**: the role that authorizes budget for service consumption. Can also be used to describe
an organization or individual that provides financial or other support for an initiative.
- **Utility**: the functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. Utility can be
summarized as **‘what the service does’** and can be used to determine whether a service is **‘fit for
purpose’**. To have utility, a service must either support the performance of the consumer or
remove constraints from the consumer. Many services do both.
- **Warranty**: assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements. Warranty can be
summarized as ‘how the service performs’ and can be used to determine whether a service is **‘fit
for use’**. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. This
may be based on a formal agreement, or it may be a marketing message or brand image. Warranty
typically addresses such areas as the availability of the service, its capacity, levels of security, and
continuity. A service may be said to provide acceptable assurance, or ‘warranty’, if all defined and
agreed conditions are met.

### 1.2 Key concepts of creating value with services
- **Value**: the perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something.
- **Output**: a tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.
- **Outcome**: a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.
- **Cost**: the amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource.
- **Risk**: a possible event that could cause harm or loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.
It can also be defined as uncertainty of outcome, and can be used in the context of measuring the
probability of positive outcomes as well as negative outcomes.
- **Organization**: a person or a group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities,
authorities, and relationships to achieve its objectives.


### 1.3 Key concepts of service relationships
• Service offering: a formal description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of
a target consumer group. A service offering may include goods, access to resources, and service
actions.
• Service relationship management: joint activities performed by a service provider and a service
consumer to ensure continual value co-creation based on agreed and available service offerings.
• Service provision: activities performed by an organization to provide services. It includes
management of the provider’s resources, configured to deliver the service; ensuring access to
these resources for users; fulfillment of the agreed service actions; service level management; and
continual improvement.
It may also include the supply of goods.
• Service consumption: activities performed by an organization to consume services. It includes

You have been assigned to a team that has been asked to identify how your consumers use a particular service, what the service helps them to do, and how the service helps them to identify their goals. Which of the guiding principles should best be applied in your situation?

'Focus on value' ensures that everything the organization does should link back, directly or indirectly, to value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders.
