### **Campaign Concept: "Davao's Urban Oasis: Your Space to Meet, Create, and Celebrate."**

This campaign repositions the mall from a simple shopping center into a dynamic destination for experiences, community engagement, and local culture. The focus is on giving people a reason to come, stay, and return, independent of sales or promotions.

### **Phase 1: The Foundation - Creating "Sticky" Spaces (Months 1-2)**

The goal of this phase is to build foundational, permanent attractions that encourage repeat, long-duration visits.

**1. The Co-Working Lounge & Student Hub:**
*   **Action:** Convert a low-traffic area into a free, comfortable co-working and study space.
*   **Features:**
    *   Reliable, high-speed Wi-Fi.
    *   Abundant power outlets and charging stations.
    *   Comfortable seating: a mix of individual desks, communal tables, and soft seating.
    *   Good lighting and a quiet-zone policy.
*   **Traffic Driver:** Attracts students, freelancers, and remote workers who will stay for hours, likely purchasing food, coffee, and other items during their stay. This creates a consistent daily population in the mall.

**2. The Community Stage:**
*   **Action:** Designate a central atrium or open area as a permanent, bookable space for the community.
*   **Features:**
    *   A small, raised platform with a basic sound system and lighting.
    *   An easy online booking system for local artists and organizations.
*   **Traffic Driver:** Provides a constant stream of new, interesting content. It can be used for:
    *   Open mic nights (poetry, acoustic music).
    *   Local dance crew practices.
    *   University club presentations.
    *   Free public seminars (e.g., financial literacy, digital marketing).

### **Phase 2: The Spark - Launching High-Impact Events (Months 3-6)**

This phase is about creating major, buzz-worthy events that draw large crowds and generate significant social media attention.

**1. "Art in the Halls" - A Live Mural Festival:**
*   **Action:** Commission 5-10 local Davao artists to paint large-scale murals on designated blank walls inside the mall over a two-week period.
*   **Execution:**
    *   Promote the artists and their work on social media.
    *   Allow the public to watch the artists work live.
    *   Host a launch party at the end to celebrate the finished murals.
*   **Traffic Driver:** This is a highly visual and "Instagrammable" event. It creates a sense of transformation, provides free entertainment, and leaves a lasting legacy that beautifies the mall and serves as a permanent photo opportunity.

**2. "Kadayawan Night Market" (Outdoor Edition):**
*   **Action:** Utilize the mall's parking lot or an adjacent open space to host a curated weekend night market, especially in the month leading up to Davao's Kadayawan Festival.
*   **Features:**
    *   Focus on unique, local food vendors not found in other malls.
    *   Include stalls for local artisans, crafts, and plants.
    *   Live music from local bands on the Community Stage.
    *   Festive lighting and ambiance.
*   **Traffic Driver:** Night markets are powerful traffic generators. By focusing on unique local vendors, you create an experience that can't be replicated by competitor malls and celebrates authentic Davao culture.

### **Phase 3: The Habit - Sustaining Momentum with Recurring Activities (Ongoing)**

This phase ensures that there is always something new, making visiting the mall a regular habit for different segments of the community.

**1. Weekly Hobbyist Hubs:**
*   **Action:** Dedicate specific times and spaces for niche community meetups.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Tuesday Board Game Night:** Partner with a local board game cafe or group.
    *   **Thursday K-Pop Random Play Dance:** A low-cost, high-energy event for a passionate community.
    *   **Saturday Morning "Mall Walkers" & Zumba:** Promote the mall as a safe, climate-controlled space for fitness before stores open.
*   **Traffic Driver:** Builds loyal, niche communities who make the mall their go-to meeting place.

**2. Monthly Themed Weekends:**
*   **Action:** Create a calendar of recurring monthly events that people can look forward to.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Pet Lovers' Weekend:** Partner with local shelters for an adoption drive and "pet-friendly" hours.
    *   **Mindanao Coffee & Cacao Fair:** Showcase local coffee bean growers and chocolatiers.
    *   **Local Authors & Book Swap Weekend:** A fair for Davao-based writers and a community book exchange.
*   **Traffic Driver:** Creates a predictable rhythm of fresh and interesting events, encouraging repeat visits month after month.

### **Marketing & Promotion Strategy**

*   **Digital:**
    *   **Social Media:** Heavy focus on Instagram and TikTok for visual content (murals, events, food). Use Facebook Events to promote the recurring activities.
    *   **Local Influencers:** Collaborate with Davao-based food bloggers, artists, and lifestyle influencers to cover the events.
    *   **Partnerships:** Cross-promote with local universities, community groups, and arts organizations.
*   **Public Relations:**
    *   Send press releases to local Davao media (SunStar Davao, Mindanao Times, etc.) for major launches like the Mural Festival and Night Market.
*   **On-Site:**
    *   Clear signage, a large "What's On" calendar, and QR codes linking to the schedule of events.

### **Measuring Success**

*   **Primary Metric:** Increase in foot traffic (measured by door counters).
*   **Secondary Metrics:**
    *   Social media mentions and hashtag usage (e.g., #[MallName]Oasis).
    *   Number of participants in workshops and community events.
    *   Dwell time (how long people are staying in the mall).
    *   Press clippings and media value.

This campaign shifts the marketing spend from temporary discounts to creating lasting assets and a self-sustaining calendar of events that make the mall an essential part of Davao's urban life.
